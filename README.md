# Kruskal-s-Algorithm-for-Minimum-Spanning-Tree
You are given a connected, undirected graph with  𝑛 n nodes and  𝑚 m edges. Each edge has a weight. Your task is to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Kruskal's Algorithm.
Explanation:
Sorting Edges: Sort all edges based on their weights.
Union-Find Data Structure: Use union-find to check for cycles while adding edges.
Building MST: Add edges to the MST if they connect disjoint sets.
Output: Print the edges in the MST and the total cost.
